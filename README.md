This page is my testing grounds, when working on front end application layers, I like to use a method that is safe for users, as well as myself.

## The Past
In the past this has been a page for: 
- Unity Games I started yet never finished (mostly due to the supreme scale of work that is needed to make a playable game, more-so when you want to create a movement shooter like I did).
- Overwatch 2 Ideal Team composition that would pick counters for your enemy team, although it more or less did not work as effectively as I thought it would lol
- Briefly was where I hosted the book I am currently writing
- At one point in time was a web-puzzle, with a series of codes, riddles and the like, to be cracked, for a prize, this was beaten in a matter of days as it was posted somewhere and was knocked out by a large group together, rather then a few people trying it for themselves
- There was one period where the page was quite literally the word "waffle" and nothing else

## The Present
Currently this page is a Star Citizen focused testing ground. For now, it just hosts my most up to date trade data, just for viewing by other players, but also for myself as I can visualize the concepts I am working on

## The Future
I am looking for Star Citizen players with a love for all things trade-based, to help me in mapping out each region. So far only the Hurston Planetary system has been finished, but we still have to work on Crusader, microTech, ArcCorp, and each of the 20 lagrange points. This is no small task, and within this source code is the python script I use to make this process easier, if you download add_to_map.py and create a map.json file, you can add your own data there and forward it to me, saving lots and lots of time. Each user who aids will get a contributer pin on the final site, along with a score, showing your level of contribution to the project.

## Just some info for ya
I am not a genius, everything you see within the application I have learned as I went. I do not usually make websites, nor do I usually map out star systems. I normally make discord bots. This is a huge adventure from the Normal code experience for me and I need it understood that things will be slow, but I am doing my best, I can assure you. I love this game, and I love this community. Thank you for your support, and most of all, your time.
